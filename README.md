# QuantumVibes: An Interactive Quantum Mechanics Toy

Ever had quantum mechanics just scramble your brain in the best way? For me, a [**Veritasium video on Path Integrals**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZ1Ez28C-A) did just that, making the idea of a particle taking *all paths simultaneously* finally click.

So, I had to build something. **QuantumVibes** is the result – a quick, browser-based toy to explore this weirdness, focusing on the Double-Slit experiment and Feynman's Path Integrals. This was a "vibecoding" adventure with an AI (Gemini), probably **1% me, 99% robot**, and about **30 prompt iterations** to wrestle it into existence.

> It's not elegant code, but it works and lets you fiddle with quantum concepts. That's the chaotic beauty of vibecoding.

## Features:

QuantumVibes lets you interactively explore two core concepts:

1.  **The Double-Slit Experiment:**
    *   Witness wave-particle duality by toggling an "observer."
    *   See the iconic interference pattern emerge (or collapse!).
    *   Powered by Web Workers for a fast histogram build-up, even with 10,000+ simulated "particles" at high speed.
    *   *(Image/GIF Placeholder: Double-Slit Simulation - to be added)*

2.  **Feynman's Path Integral Explorer:**
    *   Visualize a particle exploring numerous paths from point A to B.
    *   See how paths closer to the "path of least action" dominate.
    *   Drag start/end points and tweak path parameters.
    *   *(Image/GIF Placeholder: Path Integral Simulation - to be added)*

**Accuracy Disclaimer:** This is a *demonstration* to get the core ideas across, not a rigorously precise physics model. But the diffraction patterns look cool!

## The "Aha!" Moment

This project was about trying to capture that intuitive *click* when you finally *see* a complex idea like "light explores all paths." It's a fun, slightly unhinged experiment. Mobile might be janky, accuracy is "good enough for jazz," but hopefully, it sparks some quantum curiosity.
